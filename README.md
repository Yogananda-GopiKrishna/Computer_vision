PART-A

DOMAIN:  Botanical Research 

CONTEXT: University X is currently undergoing some research involving understanding the characteristics of plant and plant seedlings at various stages of growth. They already have have invested on curating sample images. They require an automation which can create a classifier capable of determining a plant's species from a photo. 

•DATA DESCRIPTION: The dataset comprises of images from 12 plant species.  Source: https://www.kaggle.com/c/plant-seedlings-classification/data. 

•PROJECT OBJECTIVE: To create a classifier capable of determining a plant's species from a photo.

PART-B


• DOMAIN: Botanical Research

• CONTEXT: University X is currently undergoing some research involving understanding the characteristics of flowers. They already have have invested on curating sample images. They require an automation which can create a classifier capable of determining a flower’s species from a photo.

• DATA DESCRIPTION: The dataset comprises of images from 17 plant species.

• PROJECT OBJECTIVE: To experiment with various approaches to train an image classifier to predict type of flower from the image
